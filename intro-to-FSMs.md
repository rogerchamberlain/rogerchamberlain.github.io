In this guide, we introduce the **Finite State Machine**, one of the most powerful ideas in computing. However, in order to code it in a way that's not confusing, you'll need to know a few concepts first. Namely, `switch`es and `enum`s.

## Switches

The first concept is called a `switch` statement. Itâ€™s  a more convenient way to write `if` statements that have a lot of cases. Instead of a series of comparisons to one variable, you check several different cases of a variable. For example, if you had the basic code:

	int friends = 0;
	if(friends == 0) {
		System.out.println("You have no friends.");
	} else if(friends == 1) {
		System.out.println("You have one friend.");
	} else {
		System.out.println("You have many friends");
		System.out.println("You are cool.");
	}
	
	// Prints "You have no friends."

You could instead write a `switch` statement that checks the value of `friends`:

	int friends = 0;
	switch(friends) {
		case 0:     //equivalent to if (friends == 0)
			System.out.println("You have no friends.");
			break;
		case 1:		//equivalent to else if (friends == 0)
			System.out.println("You have one friend.");
			break;
		default:	//equivalent to else
			System.out.println("You have many friends");
			System.out.println("You are cool.");
			break;
	}

	// Still prints "You have no friends."
	
Now, this is not particularly useful because we have so few cases, but it's useful to have a small example to explain the syntax:

	switch(variable) { // the variable to compare
		case 0: // runs if variable == 0 ))
				// statements
			break; // each case must end in a `break`
		default: // runs if none of the cases match
			break;
	}

You should see the value of a switch statement in a larger example:

	int month = 8;
	String monthString;
	// We designate the switch to act according the value stored in month
	switch (month) {
	// The switch will check all of the cases you list
	// This is equivalent to if (month = = 1)...
	    case 1:  monthString = "January";
	             break;
	    case 2:  monthString = "February";
	             break;
	    case 3:  monthString = "March";
	             break;
	    case 4:  monthString = "April";
	             break;
	    case 5:  monthString = "May";
	             break;
	    case 6:  monthString = "June";
	             break;
	    case 7:  monthString = "July";
	             break;
	    case 8:  monthString = "August";
	             break;
	    case 9:  monthString = "September";
	             break;
	    case 10: monthString = "October";
	             break;
	    case 11: monthString = "November";
	             break;
	    case 12: monthString = "December";
	             break;
	    // Catches all of the times when an invalid input is given
	    default: monthString = "Invalid month";
	             break;
	}
	// In this case, August would be printed
	System.out.println(monthString);

## Enums

An `enum` is a built-in data type, just like an `int`, `float`, or `String`. It lets you assign variables to be one of a series of constants you create. For example, the cardinal directions:

	public enum Direction { NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST }
	Direction treasureDirection = Directions.NORTH;

As you can see, defining an enum creates a new type with the name of your enum. From the example above, we create the `Direction` type:

	public enum Direction { NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST }

You can now use the `Direction` type like any other variable -- maybe in a switch statement:

	switch(treasureDirection) {
		case NORTH:
			// grab coats & snowboots
			break;
		case EAST:
			// pack swimsuit to cross Atlantic
			break;
		case WEST:
			// roadtrip!
			break;
		case SOUTH:
			// get some sunglasses
			break;
		default:
			System.out.println("I don't think that's a direction.");
			break;
	}

There are a couple gotchas to both `enum`s and `switch` statements, but this is enough to learn about Finite State Machines.

## Finite State Machines

A **finite state machine** is a model used in computer science to represent a stateful system and its behavior.

We introduce the **Moore machine**, one type of FSM (you learn about other types in a computer architecture course like CSE260M). In a Moore machine, you make a list of possible states your system can be in, and for each state you decide how input to your system will modify the state.

For example, imagine a computer for a traffic light. You might have three different states: red, yellow, or green. You could also have an "advance" input that progresses the traffic light. We can represent this stateful system in a FSM, and it turns out most of the time the standard is to just draw it:

![A very simple traffic light FSM, with three states G, Y, and R.](http://i.imgur.com/UC113L8.jpg)

Where each circle is a state -- green, yellow, or red -- and the arrows indicate how the one input changes the systems state. The disconnected arrow indicates the initial state.

FSMs can also take multiple inputs. You could represent a search for the letters "dog" in a string with a FSM like this, where you output some `success` variable when you're in the green state:

![A FSM that takes a string and returns true if the sequence "DOG" is present in it.](http://i.imgur.com/M90rfHi.jpg)

You can also have multiple outputs for each state. Consider the long-studied and intractible problem of getting a hot pocket fully cooked:

Notice that every state must have defined transitions for every input, in this case `nuke` and `wait`.
