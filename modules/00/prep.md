# {{ page.title }}

Here we will briefly review the class\'s resources and get you set up with the necessary tools that you need to complete the course, including a GitHub account, git repository, and both the Eclipse and Arduino IDEs.

# Review course policies

Make sure to visit the [policies]({{ "/policies.html" | relative_url }}) page to review the course policies, including:

* Grading Policy
* Late Policy
* Attendance Policy
* Collaboration Policy

You are responsible for reviewing and knowing all of this information!

# Acquire an Arduino kit

The campus bookstore is selling SparkFun Arduino kits with everything you will need for this class. You should purchase one as soon as possible, and bring it with you to all studio and lab meetings.

# Install the Arduino IDE

If you are planning to use your laptop to complete the course assignments, you will need to install the Arduino IDE. You can get it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Don\'t use the web editor, install the latest version of the IDE on your machine.

# Install the Eclipse IDE

We will use Eclipse as the tool for: (a) accessing the git repositories, and (b) authoring and executing Java programs. See the video below for instructions on how to install Eclipse. (Note: the instructions make mention of the Oxygen release, which is an old edition. Not to worry, just install the latest version.)

# Introduction to Arduino Programs

Watch the following videos for a quick introduction to Arduino programming - if these are confusing to you now, don\'t worry! You\'ll get more practice with this during the first week of class.

|Video | Description |
|:-----:|:----------:|
|[Eclipse Install](https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/2020/spring/cse131/videos/InstallEclipse/) | Professor Siever explains shows how to install the Eclipse IDE |
|[Arduino Programs](https://wustl.box.com/s/xdgu2dy4vigi7txq5qm17mv1onc3ix0g) | Watch as Professor Shook explains the basic structure of an Arduino sketch and goes through a Hello, World! program |
|[Printing](https://wustl.box.com/s/09ppka5aweq9invce6klleuk2pwvbx1l) | In this video, Professor Shook explains how to print stuff using the Arduino in more detail |
|[Arduino Timing](https://wustl.box.com/s/c3g3lxaenilnsbafgpy0gbkzpz4f4oh2) | Timing is very important - see how to control timing on the Arduino. |
|[Java Timing](https://wustl.box.com/s/06du4se1o0syu2bu6opwc0upq7djhgm9) | Next we\'ll look at how to control timing in Java |
|[Exceptions](https://wustl.box.com/s/gwdts37609gzxcngfdf24hgdvudnmu25) | Exceptions are a useful tool for managing errors that may occur in your code, such as errors that result from mistakes in our circuit timings. |
