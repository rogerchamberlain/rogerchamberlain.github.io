| Video | Description |
| [Jumps and Branches](https://wustl.box.com/s/6yfujvs26i8x4xfr4l3zx4hbo3gimvvh) | Up until this point we have only been able to write linear assembly routines. This video introduces the various branching instructions that are available. |
| [If statements](https://wustl.box.com/s/60osfg9u2kimrfsgt7kxji3hsjtp1vcv) | If we are given an if statement in C, what does that look like in assembly? |
| [Loops](https://wustl.box.com/s/0xw5puicz0o4i2qi3v7y7rentyuqvbk2) | We wrap up our assembly unit with some examples of loops. |
