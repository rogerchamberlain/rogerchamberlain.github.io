## Sparkfun Tutorial on Remote-Controlled Robot

Studio this week will primarily consist of building the robot. [This tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v41/circuit-5b-remote-controlled-robot), from SparkFun, describes the physical construction.
