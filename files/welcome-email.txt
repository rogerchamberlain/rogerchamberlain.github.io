Welcome to CSE 132!

This introductory email is intended to give you some logistical information as we get started this semester. More will be explained in the first lab meeting on Monday, Aug 30.

First, the class webpage is here:

https://rogerchamberlain.github.io/

We will use Canvas for quizzes, grades, etc., but the prep material, studio instructions, and assignments are all found on the class webpage.

There is preparatory material to do prior to the first class meeting. Check it out on the class webpage.

Do come to the lab for which you are registered on Monday, Aug 30. We might move folks around a bit, but start where you are registered.  The task for Monday is Studio 0, which can be done in groups of up to four individuals.

A typical week will have a quiz (these are the A quizzes) plus studio on Monday, and then assignment checkouts and quiz (the B quiz) on Wednesday. This week and next will be different, as there will be studios both Monday (Studio 0) and Wednesday (Studio 1) this week, with the first A quiz due before Studio 1 on Wednesday (Sept 1). Note, the A quizzes are super simple, designed to check whether or not you actually did the prep work. They are due before studio. Next week we are off on Monday for Labor Day, and the first assignment will be assigned on Wednesday (due the following Wednesday).  Assignments can be done in pairs (groups of no more than two) or solo, either is fine.  No groups of three, though.

This first week, only one member of a studio group needs to have the Arduino kit, so if you don't have one yet (or are considering whether or not to stay in the class), simply join a group where someone in the group already has a kit.

I'm looking forward to this semester, and can't wait to have you all in lab this coming week.
