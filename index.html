<p>
Welcome to the workshop!
Your instructors today are
<a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Roger-Chamberlain.html">Roger Chamberlain</a>,
<a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/James-Orr.html">James Orr</a>, and
<a href="https://engineering.wustl.edu/faculty/Bill-Siever.html">Bill Siever</a>.
<p>
The subject of the workshop is to familiarize attendees with the logistics of using a popular microcontroller platform (the Arduino Uno) to introduce fundamental concepts in computer science and computer engineering.  The Arduino Uno is quite popular in the hobbyist "maker" community, and our high-level goal is to start the transition of our students from amateur hobbyist makers into professional scientists and engineers.
<p>
Today, we will concentrate on exercises that introduce the following fundamental subject matter:
<ul>
	<li> Finite-State Machines - the use of Finite-State Machines (FSMs) to represent abstract computation, and the transformation of an abstract FSM into executing code on the Arduino Uno.
	<li> Delta Timing - the inclusion of when something happens as a formal correctness criteria, and techiques for implementing time-sensitive applications in software. 
</ul>
In addition to the fundamentals above, once you have completed the workshop, should also be familiar with the following:
<ul>
	<li> How to author sketches (the name the hobbyist community uses for programs) in Arduino's unique variant (mostly subset) of the C language.
	<li> How to compile, load, and execute sketches on the Arduino Uno platform (which is provided at the workshop) using the Arduino IDE.
	<li> How to convert raw input values (e.g., from an analog-to-digital converter) into engineering units that are meaningful to users.
	<li> How to physically construct simple circuits that comprise inputs and outputs to the Arduino.
</ul>
Finally, you will be introduced to the following:
<ul>
	<li> The semester-long course that we teach at Washington Univ. in St. Louis based on these ideas.
	<li> The textbook and full curricular materials (written by us) that are used in the course. We welcome the adoption of either portions or all of the material in courses at your institution.
</ul>

<p>
<p>
If you can, do the following prior to the workshop:
<ul>
	<li> Ensure that your laptop can attach to a USB-A cable.  Many newer laptops require a dongle to support USB-A. If your laptop supports USB-C, the dongle below would suffice:
		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-Gen1-Female-Adapter/dp/B01GGKYXVE">https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Type-C-Gen1-Female-Adapter/dp/B01GGKYXVE</a>
		<p> The issue is that the Arduino Uno cable has a USB-A male connector, and you want to have a USB-A female socket to plug it into.
	<li> Download and install the Arduino IDE.  At the URL below:
		<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software">https://www.arduino.cc/en/software</a>
		<p> Download and install the Arduino IDE 1.8.19 (the latest stable version) for whichever laptop OS you are using (they are listed under the "Download Options" on the right, Windows, Mac OS, and Linux are all supported).  You don't want to use the web editor at the very top of the page, you want to download the software.  Note, if you don't get to the second step before the workshop, no worries, it doesn't take all that long, you can do it at the beginning of the session. 
</ul>

Here the the schedule of activities for the workshop:
<ul>
	<li> 3:00-3:20 - Introduction to each other and to the workshop
		<li> 3:20-4:10 - <a href="{{ "/modules/A/studio.html" | relative_url }}">Studio A</a> - Finite-state machines
	<li> 4:10-4:30 - Break
	<li> 4:30-4:50 - Presentation describing full curricular materials
		<li> 4:50-5:40 - <a href="{{ "/modules/B/studio.html" | relative_url }}">Studio B</a> - Delta timing and emulating crickets
	<li> 5:40-6:00 - Discussion, Q&A, feedback, wrap-up
</ul>
Of course, we'll adjust this as needs arise, but we'll try to keep reasonably close to it.

Take your new Arduino Uno kit home with you and play!  Try out any of the studios or assignments in the semester-long course (see below for details).
<p>
We are happy to continue our interaction with workshop attendees after the workshop.  If you have follow-up questions about the material, would like to consider adoption of some (or all) of the materials, or just want to keep in touch, we would love to hear from you.  Feel free to contact any of the workshop organizers, as we've all taught the semester-long course many times!
<p>
Starting after the line below is the webpage for the course that the workshop is based upon.
The specifics of the webpage are from the fall 2021 semester.
If you are a faculty member at another institution and would like to adopt some or all of these materials in your department, feel free to contact me (Roger Chamberlain, roger AT wustl.edu) and I will be happy to share the information about the class that is hidden behind password protection.

<H2> Course Information </H2>
<p>
CSE 132 introduces students to fundamental concepts in the basic operation of computers, from microprocessors to servers, and explores the universal similarities between all modern computing problems: how do we represent data? How do we communicate with other computers? How do processors "think"?
</p>
<p>
We study inputs, outputs, and sensing; information representation; basic computer architecture and machine language; time-critical computation; inter-machine communication; and protocol design.
</p>
<p>
Students use both desktop systems and hand-held (Arduino-compatible) micro-controllers to design and implement solutions to problems. They also participate in active-learning sessions where they work with professors and their peers to solve problems collaboratively.
</p>
<p>Prerequisite: CSE 131 or equivalent.
