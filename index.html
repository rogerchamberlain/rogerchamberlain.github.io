<H2> Course Information </H2>
<p>
CSE 132 introduces students to fundamental concepts in the basic operation of computers, from microprocessors to servers, and explores the universal similarities between all modern computing problems: how do we represent data? How do we communicate with other computers? How do processors "think"?
</p>
<p>
We study inputs, outputs, and sensing; information representation; basic computer architecture and machine language; time-critical computation; inter-machine communication; and protocol design.
</p>
<p>
Students use both desktop systems and hand-held (Arduino-compatible) micro-controllers to design and implement solutions to problems. They also participate in active-learning sessions where they work with professors and their peers to solve problems collaboratively.
</p>
<p>Prerequisite: CSE 131 or equivalent.

Head TAs this semester are Nina Tekkey and Michael Filippini. TA hours are documented <a href="{{ "/ta-hours.html" | relative_url }}">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
This is a lecture-less class, please do the prep work and attend studio to keep up.
</p>
<p>
Lab locations are on the 2nd floor of Urbauer.  Come to the lab for which you are registered, but we may move you to a different section (at the same time) to better handle the load.
</p>
<p>
We will primarily use Piazza for communication in the class. Please use Piazza over email for asking questions.  </p>
